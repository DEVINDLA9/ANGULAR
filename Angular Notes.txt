Default Angular Folder Structure:
--------------------------------
1. E2E 
	- End to End test scripts will be available here
	- Protractor framework is used to run the end to end test cases.
		- Jasmine and Karma runner
	- app.po.ts -> Protractor file which will have PO file
	- app.e2e-spec.ts file
		- e2e -> it tells that this script is end to end script.
		- spec -> it means a specification.
2. node_modules
	- this is the folder where all the modules and libraries reside.
	- when we install any new package like below those will be residing under this module
		npm i bootstrap 
	- We will not touch this folder for development purpose.
3. src
	- this is the main work area/ app folder
	- this is the basic structure
	- app folder is the place where we will see the components, nodules, services, directives, pipes etc.,
	- app.component.ts -> this file corresponds to a component.
	- app.module.ts -> this file corresponds to a module.
	- app.service.ts -> this is corresponds to a service.
	- app.component.spec.ts -> this is corresponds to a Unit test scripts.
	- assets folder
		- styles
		- icons
		- images
	- environments folder
		- here we will be configure the variables, pipelines for DEV, QA, UAT and PROD
	- polyfills.ts
		- if the user browser is outdated one then it will add the ES6 functionality.
		- it is a backward compatible
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Booting Process:
	- main.ts
		- booting the angular application
		- this is the first file that angular will check to load and how to start an angular application.
		- We need atleast one module to be present in our main.ts
		- By default the module that is inside main.ts is - AppModule
		- BootStrapModule is the one which loads and start the application
		- THIS IS NOT RELATED TO bOOT STRAP FRAMEWORK AT ALL
		- We can change the defult AppModule to some other user defined module to load from bootstrapModule
	- test.ts 
		- test script for booting process
		- All the code inside main.ts file will be tested here in this file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- styles.css 
		-this is the global styles to the application
		- it should not be heavy
		- it should have limited typograohy, fonts, generic style classes.
4. angular.json
	- this is the configuration file for the angular project.
5. karma.conf.json
	- karma runner to run our unit test cases
	- to configure our test scripts in this file.
6. package.json
	- You can write your own script commands  to build the application pipelines
	- To understand the existing application first you should refer the package.json file
	- It will have all the dependencies and devDependencies 
7. package.lock.json
	- This will resolve all the sub dependencies/ sub modules which are mentioned in the package.json file
8. tsconfig.json -> This is to build and compile out angular application.
9. tsconfig.spec.json
10. tslint.json -> linting or coding standards
